She had come to an undersea cave, a pocket of air - a little air - and so she had untied and removed her headband, dispelling the magicked bubble of air around her. Exhausted, she let it fall out of her hand and onto the damp cave floor.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Before her, visible through her grayed vision, her eyes adjusting to the cave&rsquo;s darkness, was something akin to a flower garden. It was a decorated mass of flowering sea algae, numerous in colors, appearing to be pulsing slightly with life. She had never seen anything like it, in all her days diving beneath the waves.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Whoa,&rdquo; she felt herself let out.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">HELLO</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">A voice unlike any she had heard spoke to her in perfect clarity. Not out loud - inside her mind. She had heard of such things, but it was unusual, not to mention unexpected, to feel for the first time.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Puzzled, she beheld the wriggling seaweed like flowered mass before her. Its petals seemed to shake. Was this thing living? Talking to her?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; she tentatively whispered.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">YES HELLO THERE</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Despite the &ldquo;creature&rsquo;s&rdquo; friendly greeting, she felt her hand drift to the hilt of her blade instinctually. Though it being a plant, she would&rsquo;ve been better off with fire.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I MEAN YOU NO HARM</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Again, the voice pounded through her head, at what felt like crushing volume. It was so uniquely close. It felt a bit like she had lost control of her mind.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;What are you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Marine beheld the thing, leaning her head forward and taking it in &ndash;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">IT&rsquo;S COMPLICATED</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ndash; she noticed particulates drifting through the air, almost imperceptible but visible as clusters in motion, perhaps, lightly green in color, the flowers seeming to emanate and be surrounded by them &ndash;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">BUT AS I SAID, I MEAN YOU NO HARM</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">She swatted in front of her face. She said, talking at the general flowers before her,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;What is this stuff? Is it dangerous to me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">She looked for her handkerchief she had left on the ground in the dark.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">NO, WORRY NOT</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">THESE ARE PURELY COMMUNICATIVE SPORES SPREAD BETWEEN MY SPECIES</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;</span><span class="c5">Communicative</span><span class="c3">?&rdquo; she pondered. &ldquo;Is that how you&rsquo;re talking to me? Invading my mind?&rdquo; She brushed at her ear.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">NO I ALSO HAVE INNATE TELEPATHY</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">THE SPORES ARE ONLY FOR INTERACTING WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF MY SPECIES</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">She took pause at this. Could she trust whatever this thing is? She didn&rsquo;t want to die, forgotten in a sea cave after inhaling spores from a seemingly trustworthy clump of seaweed.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">She took hold of her handkerchief, tying it again around her head in a quick and simple double knot. It created an air bubble around her head.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Just to be safe, alright, I&rsquo;m doing this,&rdquo; although she felt she must have already inhaled some of the spores. &lsquo;There are dangers beneath the sea not meant for our understanding,&rsquo; she remembered of the old sea hag who had traded her this thing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">NO PROBLEM</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">THOUGH I ASSURE YOU THE SPORES ARE ONLY A MINOR NUISANCE TO YOUR SPECIES</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">MATTER THAT IS INARTICULATE AND MEANINGLESS TO YOU, LIKE POLLEN</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s pollen,&rdquo; she wanted to ask, but felt like she shouldn&rsquo;t bother. &ldquo;So,&rdquo; she asked instead, &ldquo;what are you? Your </span><span class="c5">species</span><span class="c6">, I mean</span><span class="c3">?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">WE HAVE STUDIED YOUR TONGUE EXTENSIVELY BUT I HAVE FOUND NO EXACT WORD</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">WE ARE FUNGI THAT DWELL THROUGHOUT YOUR WORLD, CONNECTED THROUGH TENDRILS, PHYSICAL PATHWAYS LIKE YOU SEE BEFORE YOU</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">WE COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER THROUGH THESE PATHWAYS</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">AND MANIFEST AS CLUSTERS OF FLOWERS THAT PRODUCE AND DISPERSE OUR PARTICULATE THOUGHT PATTERNS</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">AND SO ON</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Whoa, slow down,&rdquo; she said, half out of confusion, and half that the loud pulsing in her head as this thing communicated with her was overwhelming her, half-making her a bit nauseous.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Sorry, uh, what&rsquo;s your name&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I HAVE NONE</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I HAVE NO INDIVIDUAL IDENTITY</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I AM MERELY A NERVE CENTER OF ONE COLLECTIVE BEING</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Okay, well, &lsquo;nerve center&rsquo;... is it possible for you to &lsquo;talk&rsquo; a bit quieter?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">NO</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Her head throbbed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay&hellip; you said something about &lsquo;thought patterns&rsquo;? These particles are thoughts?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">YES</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">OBSERVATIONS AND MUSINGS</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">SOMETIMES QUESTIONS, CONVERSATIONS</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">BETWEEN THE CLUSTERS</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">LIKE ME</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">She beheld the odd cloud of dust before her. How could something so small and invisible be anything like that? She tried to catch some in her hand, get it to cling to her skin somehow. She watched it merely disperse back through the air. Like light dust, but almost like it had a mind of its own.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">PRODUCED BIOMATTER</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">IT IS MARKED WITH OUR THOUGHT PATTERNS</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">LIKE A DOG MARKS A TREE</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">OR LIKE HOW A SONG IS WRITTEN ON A PARCHMENT SCROLL</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">She was still befuddled by these dust motes. &ldquo;How do you know all this? Know so much, I mean. About dogs.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">WE COLLECT AND DISPERSE KNOWLEDGE</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">OBSERVATIONS</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">THROUGH THIS MATTER</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Observe? How do you observe?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">She looked for clues in the tendril of green, tendrilled limbs and flowers before her. It felt more like a collection of plants than any living organism. She didn&rsquo;t want to step on it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">THE FLOWERS CONTAIN SENSORY OBSERVERS</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">LIKE EYES</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Marine squinted at the flowers.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">BUT TOO SMALL FOR YOU TO REGARD THEM AS SUCH</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; The flower appeared just like almost any other flower. She wondered if other plants could &ldquo;see&rdquo;. &ldquo;So you see stuff, you tell other people about it through the dust spores?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">JUST OTHERS LIKE ME</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">THE SPORES ARE MEANINGLESS TO &ldquo;PEOPLE&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Marine swatted for more spores. She felt otherwise, somehow.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I WAS BORN IN THIS CAVE</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I SEE, OBSERVE VERY LITTLE OF NOTE</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">AND COMMUNICATE VERY LITTLE AS A RESULT</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Marine offered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">DON&rsquo;T BE</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I RECEIVE PLENTY FROM THE TRANSMISSIONS OF OTHERS</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">THEIR THOUGHTS, THEIR FEELINGS, THEIR OBSERVATIONS</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6 c8">AND THROUGH THIS I AM CONNECTED TO THE WORLD</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; Marine said. She was almost envious of him, this strange flowered clump of sea moss. &ldquo;These transmissions&hellip; tell me about them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">YOU CAN LISTEN TO A FEW</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I WILL TRANSLATE THEM FOR YOU</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">She became excited, like she was cracking open a chest, or corking open a message in a bottle. &ldquo;Tell me, tell me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">OKAY</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">THIS ONE SAYS</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;RACCOON KING DEAD TODAY. NOT MOURNED BY HIS FAMILY MUCH&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Marine was surprised.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">THIS IS IN REFERENCE TO AN EARLIER SERIES OF DISPATCHES ABOUT A CLAN OF RACCOONS WHO HAD APPOINTED A SORT OF LEADER FIGURE</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">WORRY NOT. I WILL READ ANOTHER</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&ldquo;ONE TWO ONE ONE ONE TWO ONE ONE ONE ONE TWO ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;What,&rdquo; Marine said, recoiling at the loud and repetitive banging in her head, &ldquo;stop doing that. What is that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A TRANSMISSION, FROM A FARAWAY NODE</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">EACH HAS THEIR OWN PERSONALITY OF SORTS</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">SOME COME WITH LITTLE EXPLANATION</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I HAVE BEEN GETTING TRANSMISSIONS WITH PATTERNS OF NUMBERS IN THEM FOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Memory, she thought. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s strange. Do you collect these?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">NO I CONSUME THEM TO RECEIVE THEM</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said. That only added further to the mystery. She thought about dispelling the bubble around her mouth and trying to inhale as many of the spores as possible, but this felt contrary to her earlier, perhaps wiser caution. Could still be toxic, she thought, but she was curious&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">THEY ALSO PROVIDE NUTRITION</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I AM PARTICULARLY DEPENDENT ON THEM, NOT ONLY FOR KNOWLEDGE</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">BUT BECAUSE THIS CAVE RECEIVES NO LIGHT</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Even with her limited knowledge of flora (and fauna), she knew mushrooms typically grew in dark places. &ldquo;You need sunlight?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">OR THE ENERGY EXTRACTED FROM IT, DISPERSED IN SPORES</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Half-absentmindedly, she lit a small, candle-like flame that floated from the palm of her hand.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Light&hellip; is this helpful for you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">NO</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">BUT IT IS INTERESTING</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep it going, then,&rdquo; she said, giving a light smile. She looked around the cave, now faintly illuminated from her palm. &ldquo;How are you getting these spores, anyway? Through the air?&rdquo; Other than the way she came in, a small gate into the ocean above like an ocular, it appeared entirely like a tiny, closed off cavern.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">CONNECTED, LIKE I SAID, TO THE OTHERS</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A TENDRIL RUNS OUT FROM ME TO THE NEXT AND SO ON</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">LIKE A ROAD, THE &ldquo;SPORES&rdquo; TRAVEL INSIDE THIS, AND ARE RELEASED INTO THE AIR BRIEFLY FROM MY ORIFICES BEFORE I CONSUME THEM</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">This whole explanation, while helpful, grossed her out a little, though she had difficulty explaining why. Maybe the fact that this creature knew what &ldquo;orifices&rdquo; were. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">THIS ROAD GOES TWO WAYS</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6 c8">IN RETURN, I DEPOSIT WHAT ENERGY I ABSORB BACK INTO THE SYSTEM</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Interesting,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;like, um&hellip; bio-lumin&ndash; um, mutual codependence.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">YES</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">THOUGH WE ARE ALL ONE ORGANISM</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">IN YOUR TERMS</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">She paused. She wondered how much of this &ldquo;thing&rdquo; there really was. She had only imagined the two nodes that had sent the messages, but she supposed she had no way of knowing how long this thing stretched.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">THIS IS THE LONGEST ANYONE HAS STOPPED HERE</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Really? You&rsquo;ve never had any other company?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Marine thought reflexively of the people that had entered, and left, her life. She felt grateful.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">YOUNG FISH, SEPARATED FROM THEIR SCHOOLS, HAVE SOMETIMES WANDERED INTO THIS CAVE</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">TO DIE HELPLESS ON ITS FLOOR</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">THEY DECOMPOSE AND ROT BEFORE MY &ldquo;EYES&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">AND I CONSUME WHAT MATTER THEY LEAVE BEHIND</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Marine gazed back through the portal to the sea.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I TRY TO OFFER WHAT SOLACE I CAN TO THEM</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">BUT THEY ARE POOR CONVERSATIONALISTS</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">She felt pity for the collection of plant matter. Such a lonely existence it lived, though she didn&rsquo;t want to voice this thought. Everything was relative, after all.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I HAD ONE OTHER VISITOR BUT HE DIDN&rsquo;T STAY LONG</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">AN &ldquo;ELVEN&rdquo; ONE</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Marine had not given thought to others, like her, wandering beneath the sea, despite its vastness, its connection to everything. That another had been where she stood.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">YES</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">HE RODE A DOLPHIN</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Marine&rsquo;s yellowed eyes sparkled in astonishment at this information. Druids were so lucky&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">HE CAME IN, BEHELD ME, AND TOOK A CLIPPING OF ME, SEALING IT IN A SMALL JAR</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Ouch,&rdquo; Marine winced. &ldquo;Without asking?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">WITHOUT ASKING</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">BUT I DO NOT FEEL PAIN</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">AND GREW THE FLOWER BACK WITHIN A FEW DAYS</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; She thought of thinking a flower or perhaps a petal for herself as a souvenir, but realized she wouldn&rsquo;t know what to do with it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">PERHAPS YOU SHOULD GO TOO SOON</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">THERE IS MUCH TO SEE IN THE SURFACE WORLD</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">She thought, but she had so much left to ask this thing. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Do you know, like, where you came from? Where you &lsquo;originate&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">FROM THE STARS</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;From the stars?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">THAT IS ALL WE KNOW</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">PASSED DOWN TO US FROM UNREMEMBERED TIMES</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">She thought about this, but didn&rsquo;t know what to make of it. Could not even be true, but rather the religion and mythos of &hellip; fungi. She supposed all of Creation was made &ldquo;from the stars&rdquo;, according to the church.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;But where do you&hellip; how big are you? Like, do you know where you stop? Can you feel the other nodes?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">NO</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">THIS CLUMP OF MASS YOU SEE BEFORE YOU IS LIKE OUR &ldquo;NERVE CENTER&rdquo;, OR BRAIN</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I CANNOT FEEL BEYOND THAT</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I ONLY KNOW OF WHAT I RECIEVE</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;The transmissions,&rdquo; she said, coming to some minor understanding of the creature.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I KNOW WE ARE ON THE SURFACE</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">IN SWAMPS, IN WOODS, IN FORGOTTEN CAVES LIKE THIS ONE</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">IN THE DEPTHS OF FORGOTTEN WELLS</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">IN THE DUNGEONS OF CASTLES</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">AND I KNOW WE ARE FAR, FAR BELOW AS WELL</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">AN EXTENSIVE NETWORK OF NODES COMMUNICATE EXCLUSIVELY BETWEEN EACH OTHER</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">THEIR TRANSMISSIONS NEVER ESCAPING THEIR OWN CLUSTER</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Woah,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;How do you know about those guys?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I EXAGGERATED SLIGHTLY</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">THEIR TRANSMISSIONS REACH OTHERS, WHO SPREAD WORD OF THEIR ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE AND SO ON</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Gossip, in other words, she thought.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">BUT THIS COLLECTIVE ITSELF EMITS UNUSUAL MATTER</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A BIT LIKE THEY &ldquo;SPEAK IN THEIR OWN TONGUE&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">BARELY DECIPHERABLE BY SURFACERS, OR THOSE LIKE ME WHO HAVE ADAPTED TO COMMON LONG AGO</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">THEY MAY HAVE MUTATED BEYOND OUR UNDERSTANDING COMPLETELY</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; she said, having not even considered why the plant was able to speak Common. She assumed it was some complex mind translation.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">She reached out, somehow compelled to touch the vines of the creature, to feel it, without thinking. It was slightly wet and slimy, and beyond that, it felt texturally as though it was lightly haired. &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;can you feel that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">NO</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Oh, alright.&rdquo; She continued feeling the plant. Down, and then up, she could feel it was a bit pointed, like the scales of her own skin, but much smaller, more gentle. It was strangely pleasant. It calmed her, for a moment.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">She supposed she did need to leave eventually. A ship awaited her return. But she felt bad leaving the creature here, to be forgotten beneath the waves.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">She pulled her lute from its shoulder sling to her front, and plucked it. It was dry, thanks to the air bubble (although it had gotten wet countless times before).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">She felt its engravings, &ldquo;Before I go, would you like to hear a song?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A SONG</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">WHAT IS THAT</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">She thought. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit like your transmissions. I play them, with this thing, though. Sound, you know?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">YES</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">She smiled, and began tuning the lute. She supposed this thing wanted to know more about the surface.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">She began playing the most popular song she knew,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;</span><span class="c4">Today</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Is gonna be the day</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">That they&rsquo;re gonna throw it back to you</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">By now</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">You&rsquo;ve surely somehow&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">STOP</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The strings of the lute twanged and reverberated against her fingers as she was caught off guard by the sudden head intrusion. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">SORRY</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">COULD YOU PLAY SOMETHING ELSE</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Like what? Any requests?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">YOU PLAY THESE SONGS, RIGHT</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, with a note of pride.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">IS THERE SOMETHING YOU&rsquo;VE WRITTEN</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">She sighed. There was, but not recently&hellip; things had been too busy. Life. Songwriting had gotten away from her.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">SOMETHING MORE LIKE YOU</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">She smiled.

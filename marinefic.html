Not something she intended to do, but judging by the man&rsquo;s agape reaction, it had a desirable, tone-setting effect.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Watch it&ndash;&rdquo; Her voice cracked and gave out from underneath her. She took an embarrassing second to clear her throat, rest her palm again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She leaned forward, and intoned into the man&rsquo;s ear in a subduing whisper, &ldquo;Watch it, okay? Just remember, you&rsquo;re paying me for my time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The man gave her a frustrated but understanding nod. She sighed. She really wish she could give herself a moment to think about whether this was worth it. But the veneer of professionalism must ever be maintained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She sat back down on the bed. &ldquo;Just, start from the beginning. Say exactly what you want. And don&rsquo;t get yourself too excited this time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The man didn&rsquo;t speak, but was visibly nervous.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sit down with me, okay?&rdquo; She traced a clawed fingernail in a circle next to her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re </span><span class="c2 c3">juuust </span><span class="c0">fine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The man took a second to &lsquo;compose&rsquo; himself. He sat down next to her, and with an intense look gathering subtly but surely in his eyes, relayed the details of his request.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I want you to pretend that you&rsquo;re my sister, and I&rsquo;m your brother, coming home after a long trip away. You greet me, and then remark about how different I look since last we&rsquo;ve seen each other. You, um, you take great admiration in the physique, I&rsquo;ve grown, and as you run your hands, your um, your hands over them, you notice my scars&ndash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Your real sister? Like, your sister from birth?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The man gave a slow nod.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Even though I&rsquo;m a </span><span class="c2 c3">demon freak</span><span class="c0">?&rdquo; She motioned to her blue skin, her twisted horns.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not necessarily about that you look like me &ndash; I actually, um, my sister died of blight when I was 4.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Marine recoiled and her nose scrunched up instinctually. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t tell me -&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about her! It isn&rsquo;t, I promise. It&rsquo;s about - it&rsquo;s just about, um.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The taboo?&rdquo; Marine strode her hand up to the man&rsquo;s chin, and being careful of her &ldquo;claws&rdquo;, grabbed him by it. His look of stupid enjoyment was almost enough to make her smile in spite of everything she&rsquo;d have to do next.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She let out a sigh, and let go of the man&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it for thirty more gold, but the &lsquo;roleplay&rsquo; is part of your time, so please keep it brief.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2 c3">Thirty</span><span class="c0">?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Perfectly reasonable,&rdquo; she said, trying to downplay the man&rsquo;s anger. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re paying not just for me, but for my performance,&rdquo; she said, betraying a slight grin.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You know, you&rsquo;re not the only </span><span class="c2 c3">whore</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in this damned town&ndash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2 c3">Watch it</span><span class="c2">.&rdquo; Her eyes glowered. She saw a spark of yellow reflected back at her in the man&rsquo;s, now terrified eyes. New. &ldquo;I am the only </span><span class="c2 c3">whore</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in the room with you, right now. And I assume you want to walk out of here&ndash;&rdquo; she sighed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She was out of money, completely. Out of tricks, too. She hadn&rsquo;t learned a thing since being in here, only that everyone kept a belt and a half between them and their coin, and there wasn&rsquo;t much of that coin in the first place. It might be time soon to get out of here, pull up stakes. But for the time being, she needed to eat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2 c3">Refreshed and happy?</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The john&rsquo;s gaze returned to its tentative, half-aroused state. &ldquo;I only have twenty more gold, is all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Marine&rsquo;s eyes narrowed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Twenty, ah, twenty-eight, or thereabouts. You can check, check my pack over there, it&rsquo;s &ndash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She gave herself one last sigh. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do. Okay, well, how do we do this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The man cleared his throat. &ldquo;Well, I would be coming back in the room, on account of the &ndash; do you remember I mentioned the long trip away?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So I walk in, and you could be doing something womanly, like chopping onions or something.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You have onions in here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, actually. But maybe you could like&ndash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Is the </span><span class="c2 c3">sex </span><span class="c0">not womanly enough for you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The man&rsquo;s gaze shifted away. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just get started.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He walked out of the room, gently closing the door behind him. </span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Marine fixed her earrings back on, though she suppose she ought to sell those soon as well. She didn&rsquo;t want to, though, seemed unsacred. They were a gift. It was bad enough selling her sword. As she got up and pulled her lute case over her shoulder, she thought of the day that might come when she would have to sell that as well. She shuddered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, you got anything to eat?&rdquo; Marine asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The man lay on the bed in half-sleep. His chambers were dingy and crowded, and the whole building smelled strongly of ale and faintly of two-day-old fish. It was extraordinarily unlikely, looking around the 10 by 10 foot space, that there would be any food here of the non-spoiled variety.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Humm, uh. No&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He didn&rsquo;t seem all that certain, so Marine went through his pouch anyway as she was collecting her payment. Not a crumb. What did men like this, who despite living so poorly, held tight their pockets full of saved-up coin for fancies like her, </span><span class="c2 c3">eat </span><span class="c0">anyway? She imagined him scarfing down a freshly caught trout on some wooden raft in the sea. It almost made him seem more charming, at least in her mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m playing a show tomorrow night,&rdquo; she mentioned off hand as she was cleaning out his bag. &ldquo;You might like to come, lots of ballads and so on about the sea. I get about twenty minutes, and there&rsquo;s lots of other performers too. Some of them are actually half-good.&rdquo; She smiled to herself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;At the Rusty Pontoon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2 c3">Hunh</span><span class="c0">?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;At the Rusty. It&rsquo;s a bar.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The man didn&rsquo;t move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You ever been to a bar?&rdquo; she asked with a high note of bored sarcasm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t drink&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2 c3">Really</span><span class="c0">?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The temple, ah&hellip; don&rsquo;t let drinkers in.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She gave a surprised laugh. She was surprised further to realize he was being completely sincere.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be off. Thanks for your&hellip; yeah.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She was eager to get out of the building. Bathing in the sea was far preferable to wading in that thick air.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was still early evening, the last drip of sunset lost over the horizon, the sky now a gentle gray over the sea. Seagulls still cawed, peddlers made their last rounds before the streets became <br>&ldquo;unsafe&rdquo;. She tried to regain a bit of energy as she made her way down the street. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She tried to think about playing tomorrow, about her songs, about songs in general, about what she would sing, about what she would say to the crowd. How big would the crowd be, she wondered, her eyes casting back and forth along the wharf&rsquo;s streets. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She saw old ladies with garments that looked like newspaper sweeping meaningless shops and selling meaningless fishes, and burly looking men with baker&rsquo;s boy hats toting sacks of unidentified substances. Of all the rotten places to get dropped in, she was here, among the boring and old. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She supposed the world couldn&rsquo;t just be full of energy and youth. She didn&rsquo;t feel particularly energetic or youthful. There were days here where she just felt spent, like she was blending in somewhere in between the gray of the sky and the gray of the sea. Even the pain of hunger, when it interceded, felt gray.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She had her moments though. Some things felt good. Sometimes even the sex, tentative as she was about it, felt good, when it was empassioned &hellip; she was surprised by how much attention she&rsquo;d gotten from the village of fishermen. When she was aboard the ship, she felt like she was never sure what was &ldquo;real&rdquo; about her appearance, like everyone was just playing some game with her, letting her feel what she wanted to feel, even Gren, who she knew liked her, it was just &hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was how everything felt, her strange, flawed memories of a violent and fantastic life, and the here and now. On the ship and off the ship, two wholly different realities, one which was crafted by her insane and deranged loved ones, and the other by the sane and deeply uninteresting world&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, it wasn&rsquo;t as though the passing affection of a bunch of grunting drunks was going to be enough to make her feel &ldquo;whole&rdquo;. It wasn&rsquo;t even enough to afford a decent living. She was stuck here, that was worth admitting, wasn&rsquo;t it? Stuck with no way out. It was like she was a kid again, and she had best hop aboard another pirate ship to get out of here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She was bored. There was nothing to do today but hang out by the bar and spend her little pittance away on the usual soup and maybe a fish from the market if she felt particularly extravagant. She didn&rsquo;t even really feel hungry anymore.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She thought about what the man said. &ldquo;The temple&rdquo;. She had to think, but she knew vaguely where it was. What it was, what it was about, was another question.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She knew what she believed &ndash; that&rsquo;s what she thought, &ldquo;</span><span class="c2 c3">back then</span><span class="c2">&rdquo;. But in the gray and uncaring expanse of the world, it seemed her belief in herself didn&rsquo;t matter. She could call herself a spark of orange flame, descended from demons and dragons and the leviathans and pirate-kings of yore, but she would still be crushed by the sand and the waves all the same. </span><span class="c2 c3">Mortal</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Meaningless. &ldquo;Demon-freak&rdquo;. &ldquo;Whore&rdquo;... she wondered how many of the other fishermen&rsquo;s friends called her that. Did they make fun of him, she wondered, as he went to spend his pay on the little stray demon-freak that washed ashore? She wondered what else they said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was little wonder she wasn&rsquo;t able to pull more appreciative audiences in this town. She felt grim, drained. She was worn out from what little walking she&rsquo;d done. She wanted to collapse, and cry, right there on the gravel of the street.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Curiously, she was at the temple.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Marine gazed at the temple doors, red with rounded tops. The building was yellow clay. She pressed her hand against it, to confirm that it was just a normal building. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t catch on fire,&rdquo; she giggled to herself. Of course, &ldquo;her catching on fire&rdquo; had been happening a lot lately, and it didn&rsquo;t seem like something she was particularly in control of. It was just one of those things she assumed everyone had to deal with. Or at least something similar. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She listened at the door. No sound came from within. Her curiosity, or her boredom, or her desperation to act out got the better of her. She leaned gently on the door until it swung in for her, and took a peek inside. </span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4 c3">For the last time</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4 c3">I won&rsquo;t say goodbye</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Marine murmured. She folded up the slip of paper and let it gently fall beside the bed, disappearing somewhere into that mess.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re writing another song, show me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Marine made a joking scowl at him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not ready yet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I show you my drafts.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s </span><span class="c2 c3">different</span><span class="c0">. Also, your stories come out good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&mdash; You&rsquo;re just buttering me up,&rdquo; he protested, but his sweet smile betrayed him. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And what if I was?&rdquo; Marine pressed herself into him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re changing the subject! The song, show me the song,&rdquo; he said, laughing and jokingly pushing her off. Marine was naturally deeply hurt by this, but she did her level best to shrug it off.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;There is no </span><span class="c2 c3">song</span><span class="c0">, it&rsquo;s just an idea of a lyric for a song. I can&rsquo;t show you, it&rsquo;ll&hellip; it&rsquo;ll be so much less profound!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I find you very profound, you know that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shut up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">They kissed. It was still fresh and violent and meaningful every time. Marine didn&rsquo;t want to stop kissing him, ever. She let her hands feel his skin, not wandering down, but just holding onto him, remembering his touch. It was like he was warm in a way no one else was warm. Of course, maybe the two of them were really warm in a way that no one else was warm &ndash; their </span><span class="c2 c3">infernal legacy</span><span class="c0">. She let go of his mouth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Being in love was a terrible affliction. It made everything too real and far too serious. The truth was, she didn&rsquo;t care if anyone read her lyrics or her draft of lyrics ever before that moment. In fact, she would gladly share them or sing horrible little improvisations to complete louts like Hogger and Mildew, who were as likely to burp to the melody as anything else. Gren made her uniquely sensitive, uniquely vulnerable, because everything she said meant too much, threatened the tenuous connection that bound their souls and minds and not least of all bodies, the little temple of secret knowledge they shared which was founded on them knowing each other more than anyone, being a part of each other, that could be threatened far too easily and severely by cracks arising from that foundation. She loathed to admit this, because she was the type of person who insisted that all the world could be bent to her will had she the voice to bind them to listen to her, but she hated to consider him not liking her songs, even her drafts of songs, even her drafts of lyrics of songs. She hated the idea of watching him look at her pathetic little scrap of paper and going, &ldquo;hm,&rdquo; feigning a polite interest he didn&rsquo;t actually possess, with his superior writerly intellect allowing him to see through her cheap bardly tricks. She hated the idea of him pretending, saying, &ldquo;no, really, believe me, it&rsquo;s so good!&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Marine just wanted to gaze into his soft, forgiving emerald eyes forever, and while she hated to admit this too, but for the first and only time in her life, she wanted for none of this to matter, she just wanted to disappear into those eyes and she wouldn&rsquo;t be some flawed, sensitive half-girl creature aboard a ship to nowhere. She could just be &ldquo;with him&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why couldn&rsquo;t this last forever?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Marine. Are you okay?&rdquo; Gren quietly proffered, his lips moving slowly as he spoke like he was worried of breaking a statuesque impression.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, fine. I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; she said back, though she realized &ndash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just staring at me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is that so bad?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Um, no, I&rsquo;m kinda into it, actually.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shut up.&rdquo; She tackled into him, really just pulling herself into him again so she could naturally be held in his arms. She thought to herself, &ldquo;This sucks, I hate this,&rdquo; but it was also nice to be held. She breathed deeply of the two feelings for a while. Thankfully he didn&rsquo;t get hard again, she was enjoying just this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Your, um,&rdquo; Gren lowly murmured. Her horn had somehow caught on the chain of his necklace.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a bit of awkward in and out, she untangled herself from this predicament. She put her hands on the necklace. It was cold, wrought steel that matched the chain, but the back of it was somewhat wet with Gren&rsquo;s chest sweat. It was a uniquely shaped star, made up of several symmetrical arcs, with a small circular hole at its center. A symbol of the All-Mother.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You really believe in that stuff,&rdquo; she felt herself lowly whispering, and as she had just let it out, she instantly regretted it. A threat to their love, their understanding of each other being the only thing that mattered, and she had produced it out of thin air.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mhmm,&rdquo; he said, his half-closed eyes and smile reassuring her that not all was lost just yet. &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t?&rdquo; She quizzically turned an eyebrow up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I do, I do. It&rsquo;s not the um, well. I&rsquo;m not a monk or anything. I wouldn&rsquo;t be here otherwise, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She smiled at him. They were on a pirate ship!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But, yeah, I believe in it. The All-Mother, the three Sisters. That there was a point to this Creation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She gave too much of a pause at this, and in the silence gathered too much uncertainty. There was nothing else in her mind but what she thought, so she finally broke down and just said it,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But where does that leave us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re&hellip;&rdquo; She touched his skin pointedly. &ldquo;Demons. Fiends. We&rsquo;re half-souls who don&rsquo;t belong in this world.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo; Grenoldt never betrayed the same sensitivity to &lsquo;being a tiefling&rsquo; that Marine did. He wore it naturally, like it was no different than his hair color. Marine looked at her skin and remembered blunt kicks landing in her stomach, bottles flung at her on the street, loud shouts roaring at her from out of nothing, out of the void, out of the corner of her eye.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just. She made everyone &lsquo;this way&rsquo;, right? She made all of Creation, and all of us, or whatever?&rdquo; She fidgeted with the chain, pulling on it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the gist of it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then why make us &lsquo;this way&rsquo;; why make us demons and hated, and, and criminals? Why make me&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gren&rsquo;s face turned as he realized what she was saying. He grabbed her hands. He could be so sweet at the wrong moments. She just wanted to yell and cry or something, like she usually did when she thought about things like the fate of the universe. Marine saw him start to form words to break the silence, but she felt the need to purge herself further.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all against us, you know? They only want to hurt us. What does it matter &ndash; their gods, or their chains &ndash; I&rsquo;m sorry &ndash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, baby, you&rsquo;re okay.&rdquo; Gren took her in closer. She could feel tears starting to well up, which made her hate herself. Why couldn&rsquo;t she articulate herself for once? She was just trying to explain herself, and she had broken down like a child. Why did being around Gren always make her such an embarrassing child, she thought, pulling out of his embrace.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I - no, I am, I am, Gren. I just want to know, like, what you see in it.&rdquo; She was staring into his eyes again, too intently, but it helped her center herself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&hellip; You&rsquo;re right, you know. I don&rsquo;t know why all of Creation is the way it is, or why we were born like this, or why anyone was.&rdquo; His hand drifted to hers, almost desperately. She held it sympathetically.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gren continued. &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s hard. I don&rsquo;t think of the Mother as someone who &lsquo;helps&rsquo;, really, if that makes sense. I just find that the world is, you know. It&rsquo;s full of misery, and wrongness, and injustices, but it&rsquo;s also beautiful. Isn&rsquo;t it, don&rsquo;t you find it beautiful that&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He fretted with some tuft in the blanket for a second. &ldquo;I find it beautiful, being here with you. And I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re a half-soul, or a demon, or anything. I think you&rsquo;re beautiful, and wanted, and I think that&rsquo;s how the Mother made you. And I think it&rsquo;s beautiful that &ndash; that I can be with you, and the moments we spend together even on this blasted damned ship are &ndash; they wouldn&rsquo;t be possible, they wouldn&rsquo;t, um, make sense to me,&rdquo; he fidgeted with the chain now, himself, &ldquo;if there wasn&rsquo;t something behind that beauty.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After a moment of silence, Gren, unable to make sense of Marine&rsquo;s ponderous reaction to this, offered, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why they call her the Heart of Creation. Not because she&rsquo;s literally down there, like, at the center of the planet or something, but, because no matter what ugliness is on the outside, the heart of all things is beautiful.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Marine hummed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What? What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Gren sounded genuinely concerned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so fucking - you&rsquo;re such a fucking dork!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Marine pushed him down by his wrists and kissed him violently wherever she wanted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&ldquo;I - hate - you - you - know that?&rdquo; she suggested, between kisses.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gren laughed, enjoying himself too much, &ldquo;I know, I know - ow!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You like it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Just don&rsquo;t leave too much of a mark, please&hellip; Zork keeps giving me shit for it&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; she said, coming up for air and adopting a purposefully ridiculously sultry tone, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave you just the way the Mother made you.&rdquo; A moan eclipsed Gren&rsquo;s mouth before he could offer a reply.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The temple, such that it was, appeared completely empty, dusty and still in the tranquil darkness of nighttime. It became curious to Marine why the doors were unlocked, but she supposed there must be little of value in such a place. &ldquo;The temple at the end of the world!&rdquo; she thought to herself. &ldquo;The temple at the precipice of nothingness! The palace of oblivion!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She walked the aisles and ran her hands along the dusty pews. She tried to remember seeing people go into this church &ndash; not many, as she could recall. She wondered what the &ldquo;service&rdquo; was like, as she approached the central lectern. She had never seen the priest about town, though it was understandable why their paths rarely crossed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">It was too dark to clearly see, so she produced a small flame in her hand, cradling it gently forward. She was tired. More than that, she was </span><span class="c2 c3">tired</span><span class="c0">. Of everything. Of the then and the now, of the waiting, of the long gaps between what felt like living, of her passions disappearing into memory, of herself disappearing against the disgusting fantasies of idle fishermen. She wanted to be so much more than this. &ldquo;She would get there&rdquo;, is what she wanted to tell herself, but she wondered at the how. What circumstances would bring her into being a captain of the seas when she could barely negotiate for the lesser half of a fisherman&rsquo;s monthly salary?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sitting alone in the dark temple, it felt peaceful, but nervous. She could feel herself &ldquo;freaking out&rdquo;. She slung her lutecase in front of her and unbuckled it, pulled it out just to feel it in her hands. She picked at the strings, not touched in days, reverberating a little dust off of them. She set the flame in her other hand to float nearby.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She re-tuned her instrument. It was beautiful, the most beautiful thing she&rsquo;d ever owned, would ever own. She gave it a satisfying strum once it was in tune. Something about the acoustics of the abandoned temple made it sound particularly beautiful. She ran her hand along its handle, then the delicate and subtle engravings in its wooden base. Still good as new.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thanks, Gren,&rdquo; she said out loud to herself. &ldquo;I miss you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She looked around. The temple was still dark and still. She felt the presence of no gods, no mothers, and no fishermen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This one&rsquo;s for you,&rdquo; she said, a bit louder. &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re with the Mother now. I really do.&rdquo; Her words, said to no one, felt more true once she had said them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She started playing, the same song she had been playing different iterations of over and over, letting it come out gentle and slow this time, like a breathing exercise, rather than fast and shouted and wretched. This way, it felt like a dream, or something like one of her dreams, anyway;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2 c4 c3">Staring at death</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4 c3">I take a breath</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">There&rsquo;s nothing left</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2 c4 c3">Now close my eyes</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4 c3">For one last time</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">And say goodbye</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2 c4 c3">Lying naked while the snow falls all around me</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Drifting closer to the edge but she won&rsquo;t have me</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2 c4 c3">Wake up in sweat, full of regret, try to forget</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">These memories, lurking beneath, lost in a dream</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Excuse me, young - you there?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Marine dropped her lute out of her hands in surprise. An old man with a white beard in pajamas held a candlestick out from a door Marine hadn&rsquo;t seen in the right-back corner of the temple.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He had a warm, serene smile, and he spoke in a gentle and unalarming tone. It was only his appearance which had caught her so off guard &ndash; the man&rsquo;s white beard and white pajamas made him look something like a ghost. Or what she had heard ghosts might look like, anyway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid the temple is closed for the day&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m - I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m really sorry &ndash;&rdquo; She gathered up her lute, and noticing the flame next to her had suddenly grown in luminosity, decreased it back to a normal dim light.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. Our next service is at Munday at 9.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh that&rsquo;s &ndash; that&rsquo;s okay. I&rsquo;m really sorry, I just didn&rsquo;t think anyone was here.&rdquo; She picked herself up and got ready for a quick and spirited exit, once this horrifying interaction was over.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Unless, well. You&rsquo;d like to talk some? Make a confession?&rdquo; The old man implored. There wasn&rsquo;t accusation in his tone, more, &ldquo;curiosity&rdquo;?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh - oh dear. No, I&rsquo;m really sorry, I just wandered in here, I guess because it was a bit chilly outside.&rdquo; That wasn&rsquo;t even particularly true. &ldquo;I really have no, have no reason to be here, I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s quite alright. The temple is a place of respite for everyone. That is what the Mother teaches us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh boy&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I quite enjoyed your singing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s nice of you to say. But really, I&rsquo;ll&ndash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You have a gift!&rdquo; He had an authority in his voice that made it seem as though when he started talking, it was the gentlest thing and you couldn&rsquo;t possibly have so cold a heart as to interrupt him. It was beginning to dawn on Marine that this priest was something of an odd character, and she had best extract herself from this situation with greater urgency. And yet, what she said was, &ldquo;Thank you, I actually play at the Rusty Pontoon tomorrow night.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ohhhh, wonderful. I&rsquo;m very happy for you.&rdquo; He sounded somehow mildly happy for her. &ldquo;And the flames too? Very nice.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh that&rsquo;s &ndash; I&rsquo;m sorry, I can put that out.&rdquo; She did so, leaving only the candle in the old man&rsquo;s palm illuminating them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Woah!&rdquo; the old man said. &ldquo;Quite impressive. Unfortunately,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Marine couldn&rsquo;t find it in herself to walk out of the door.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be able to attend your concert. See, there&rsquo;s nothing forbidding me necessarily from going to the Rusty Pontoon, it&rsquo;s just that the temple-going people might see me there and feel awful guilty about their drinking and gambling and whatnot.&rdquo; He gave a wide warm smile about this, illuminated now somewhat eerily by the candlelight, as though he derived serene pleasure from the thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Right, right. Temple-goers.&rdquo; She was suddenly reminded of the man saying he had gone to the temple, which was what had made her come to the temple in the first place. This wasn&rsquo;t even an hour ago but seemed ages in the past. &ldquo;I can imagine that would be difficult, um. Managing morality. In a place like this.&rdquo; What was she saying? She was a tiefling who had just pretended to be someone&rsquo;s sister in bed. She needed to get out of this awful place.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t know the half of it, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo; Marine felt she did in fact know the half of it. &ldquo;What brings you to town, anyway? It&rsquo;s not often this place sees a new face.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m just&hellip;&rdquo; Passing through? That wasn&rsquo;t exactly true. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, really. I just washed up one day, I guess.&rdquo; That felt painfully true, once it had left her lips.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The old man gave a curious smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Perhaps you might like to tell me how that came to pass?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh, fuck.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3 c4">Unchosen paths, a broken past, forspoken wrath</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4 c3">The pain won&rsquo;t cease, I&rsquo;ll find no peace, no sweet release</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4 c3">Fragile creatures, we are taught to fear the reaper</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4 c3">Ever running, we are dead before we meet her</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c2 c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Marine pulled her blade from out through the man&rsquo;s chest, sloughing his body off on the ground beside her. The front of her blouse had been stained with blood. &ldquo;Damn it,&rdquo; she scoffed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Got nicked?&rdquo; Eroll asked with half-concern, calling out from nearly across the breadth of the cavern. She could hear, though she didn&rsquo;t see, a familiar burst of radiant light produce itself from from his hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t worry. Just, my shirt got ruined.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He chuckled, as his boots made careful steps on the cave floor towards her. &ldquo;Tis dirty work, Captain. No place for the vanity of a gentlelady like yourself!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I told you to stop calling me that,&rdquo; she smirked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What, lady or captain?&rdquo; Errol came into view from out of the darkness, a scrawny, short, sturdily built man in tight leathers that had been recently stained with mixtures of the blood of various beasts and men. From out of his left palm, remnants of divine light faintly lit him up at first, then collapsed into sparkles as he discarded it, causing her eyes to dilate slightly into darkvision. &ldquo;My knight in shining armor,&rdquo; she joked aloud.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He gave her a faint wry smile, and said nothing. He sheathed his rune-writ scimitar in its scabbard, and extended a hand forward to her. Marine cringed a little at this. She knew a bit too well how she was supposed to see this gesture, and the thought of swooning into his arms made her want to vomit a little. Men were all too much the same, she thought, taking his help getting herself up out of respect, and then being sure to let go of his hand briskly;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2 c3">Both</span><span class="c2">. I haven&rsquo;t been a pirate in a decade, and I don&rsquo;t know that anyone&rsquo;s ever called me a </span><span class="c2 c3">gentle lady</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;before. For obvious reasons,&rdquo; she said, sheathing her own sword behind her back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Tis your ship I serve on, my lady, so are you not my captain? And if I may suggest, was there ever a fairer flower of ladyhood than you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh, brother. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have time for this.&rdquo; She turned, produced a tiny fireball into her hands, and hurled it dramatically forward into the cave, watching the arc of its path travel into and through the darkness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;See anything?&rdquo; Errol asked, after watching it fade out from view.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No&hellip; nothing. I just have the faintest suspicion we&rsquo;ll catch our deaths in this damn place.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He put on a purposefully ridiculous tone. &ldquo;Tis no one I&rsquo;d rather follow&ndash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Shut up.&rdquo; She drew her weapon out again, and beckoned him forward with a tilt of her head, further into the depths of darkness. &ldquo;Come on then, </span><span class="c2 c3">matey</span><span class="c0">. We&rsquo;re far from done here yet.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Errol nodded back at her, and produced a faint glowing orb of light from his hand, which then exploded into a series of smaller motes that orbited around them, enveloping them in a gentle aura.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;All I was saying, is are you really worried about dying </span><span class="c2 c3">here</span><span class="c0">? After everything you&rsquo;ve done?&rdquo; Errol proffered, keeping his eyes focused ahead, darting his lights around slightly and scanning for movement. Despite his words, his scimitar stayed ready, the runes on its blunt edge glowing a light blue.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m </span><span class="c2 c3">always </span><span class="c0">worried about dying. You would be too, if you weren&rsquo;t young, and stupid, and thinking with that cock of yours.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She could hear him flush with silent embarrassment, which was almost satisfying enough to make her giggle, but it would have betrayed her authoritative tone, so she kept it in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How old are you, anyway?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Is that any question to ask the </span><span class="c2 c3">gentle-lady</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;you&rsquo;re attempting to </span><span class="c2 c3">court</span><span class="c0">?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Just making conversation. Captain.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She ought to give him a quick stab, just for kicks. Not like he couldn&rsquo;t make it better&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Errol wasn&rsquo;t one to let a question disappear, and continued, &ldquo;You look&ndash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m </span><span class="c2 c3">thirty-eight</span><span class="c0">, if you must know. How old are you, anyway?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Twenty-four.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Lord. You know what I was doing when I was twenty-four?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You </span><span class="c2 c3">really couldn&rsquo;t</span><span class="c0">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The Mother teaches us to offer our services to all in need, not just those who adhere to her Words, or even believe in her. I&rsquo;m offering to lend an ear is all, nothing more,&rdquo; the old man explained, reading her hesitation well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">T&rsquo;was almost enough to ease it, but she questioned whether he would really have wanted to hear which of the members of his chapel were living out their incestuous fantasies with the demon next door. The shock might knock the old cleric out, she feared, only half-un-seriously.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s, ah&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She produced the idea in her mind of saying, &ldquo;Oh, I really have to get going,&rdquo; grasping it firmly, like it was the pick that would turn the tumbler of the lock that kept her here, and set her free. She thought about it, but what did she really stand to lose? She had nothing to do, she was utterly bored and she needed a way to get her mind off her hunger somehow. And what was really the harm in it, other than the aforementioned threat to the priest&rsquo;s life?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;To put it lightly, I was with&hellip; I was living an unsavory life before I came here. Mostly traveling from place to place. From when I was very young, before I knew any better. And I had&ndash; I had had&ndash; I had had enough of it,&rdquo; she said, balling her fist a bit instinctually. She noticed it, and was worried about seeming like an unhinged mess in front of the priest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sin doesn&rsquo;t concern me, child. &lsquo;Tis only the soul that is not at peace with their sin that does.&rdquo; He gave another warm, comforting grin.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Right, </span><span class="c2 c3">sin</span><span class="c2">,&rdquo; she said, her tone giving away her thoughts accidentally. She let silence envelop them for a moment, before remembering she was supposed to speak. Surely, she had more to talk about than piracy or prostitution. She thought about </span><span class="c2 c3">sin</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A friend of mine&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her breath almost caught in her throat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A friend I used to have told me, &lsquo;sin was whatever betrays the soul&rsquo;&rdquo;. He also said that laying down the footsoldiers of corrupt monarchies and taking back the coin of the people from their coffers is food for the soul, which Marine thought wasn&rsquo;t worth mentioning. &ldquo;Like, it was different for every person. I suppose I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s&ndash;if that&rsquo;s actually what&rsquo;s written down in the Words or not. Is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The old man thought on this, for just a moment. &ldquo;Tis an astute reading. It&rsquo;s a tricky thing to pin down. Some are quite vigilant about sin, others believe it to be&hellip; how might you put it? A natural part of Creation. That which originates from the soul, originates from the Mother.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This gave Marine a moment of pause. She remembered quite suddenly that she was a tiefling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He was a follower of the Mother, your friend?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes. He was. He wasn&rsquo;t a priest, or anything.&rdquo; Though, Marine thought, this was the first time she had ever spoken to a priest, and it was eerie in certain ways how much this old fart sounded like Gren. </span><span class="c2 c3">Was Gren a priest?</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;She remembered then that priests are supposed to be celibate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&ldquo;He was just&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know if he was really a follower, or, I&rsquo;m not sure. I don&rsquo;t really know. I know he read the Words but he read a lot of things. He kept these stacks of tomes and scrolls and he scribbled notes and little things all over them. He believed&hellip; probably just as much in any of them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;All of Creation is the voice through which the Mother speaks, if one knows how to listen,&rdquo; the old man said, smiling quite genuinely, and speaking as though he was quoting something.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Right&hellip; I remember him saying something like that, more or less. He, um&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s with the Mother now?&rdquo; the old man offered. It took the breath out of her to hear that. She hated hearing it put like that. She would rather have said &ndash; his body is fish food at the bottom of the sea. Anything else felt dishonest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Almost two years ago, now. Yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Passing is a part of nature, but that doesn&rsquo;t make it any easier for the living. You were&hellip; close?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Marine cringed and wanted to leave. She felt a sinking feeling develop in her chest. She remembered everything she had forgotten about why she shouldn&rsquo;t be in a temple. &ldquo;Um, I don&rsquo;t &ndash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Tis the Mother&rsquo;s love that binds all of us, child.&rdquo; Marine didn&rsquo;t like being called </span><span class="c2 c3">child</span><span class="c0">, but she was grateful she wasn&rsquo;t about to be cast out of the temple for &ndash; well, a number of things. &ldquo;These are hard times, and it&rsquo;s love that can comfort us through those hard times. It is hard to lose that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She wanted to cry. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;thank you,&rdquo; quietly this time. &ldquo;I miss him. You&rsquo;re right, it&rsquo;s &ndash; it&rsquo;s just that things would be so much easier if he were still here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Child, I&rsquo;ve been here a long time, longer than I care to count. I&rsquo;ve watched many people exit those temple doors and never come back. I&rsquo;ve felt this pain you&rsquo;re going through, no small fraction of it, each and every time. I loved all of those people like they were my own family. Despite their sins, their misgivings. Tis my charge to look after them. To shepherd the Mother&rsquo;s children. I regret&hellip; I&rsquo;ve failed at this too many times. Too many times to count.&rdquo; He closed his eyes and smiled in spite of his own words. &ldquo;Tis a pain&hellip; too great for anyone to bear. To watch someone go, knowing they won&rsquo;t return. I can&rsquo;t offer any counsel that will make that burden easier.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His candle had practically withered to its wick. He continued, &ldquo;Only, know he is at peace now. The same peace you &ndash; we all will share with him one day.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Marine couldn&rsquo;t help herself from crying through the priest&rsquo;s words. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; is all she could muster in response.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The old man, who had been sat on a stool across from her pew, reached out his wrinkled hand to rest it gently on her arm. She almost recoiled on instinct, but didn&rsquo;t. She realized no threat was meant from this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Only, we are far from that day. You still much more life to live, much more so than myself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She winced at this news, self-conscious and feeling overwhelmed by this sudden closeness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be okay,&rdquo; he said, pulling back his hand delicately as he pulled himself off his stool. &ldquo;You will find both&hellip; pain, and comfort, in the Mother&rsquo;s world. In her beauty.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Without much more formality, he announced, &ldquo;Forgive me, child, but I am old, and need my rest. Stay as long as you like, and you are welcome back here anytime. Day or night.&rdquo; He blew out the candle, casting the temple back into its gentle darkness, and on light and slow steps, left Marine there in the temple, on the precipice of nothingness. She let tears fall into her hand for a minute longer, then stilled herself. She slung her lute back over her back and proceeded out the arced doors, out unto the dark and awful world.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You sack of shit,&rdquo; she spat, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t leave me here. Not like this.&rdquo; Marine pressed at his wound, attempting to stop the bleeding, and began incanting a curative spell, as her palms lit up with a gentle flame. She stared intently at the site of the rupture, reciting her spell sharply.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I - I &hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Errol, you&rsquo;re going to be okay. You&ndash;you have much more goddamned life to live. Much more than me,&rdquo; she felt her voice trembling. She separated one of her hands from the spell and grabbed his limp arm by its wrist and thrust it into the site of the wound, &ldquo;Help me, damn it, I can&rsquo;t do this without you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She looked for a glint of that same golden light to reveal itself from his hands. She looked in his eyes, finding him out of focus.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Errol! Please!&rdquo; she shouted at him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re&hellip; so beautiful&hellip; it&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;this is&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You piece of shit! It&rsquo;s not the fucking time, Errol! Stay with me!&rdquo; She recited the spell again, feeling the last of the magic leave her body and course into his. His wounds wouldn&rsquo;t mend. &ldquo;Damn you, Errol, focus! You can live!&rdquo; She watched his face start to slow. Start to still. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;NO! FUCK YOU!&rdquo; She thrust her mouth into his, giving him a long and thrashing series of kisses. When she finally pulled away from him, she watched him smile once more.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You asshole! Heal yourself! Errol, please, stay with me. Stay with me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was no use. His smile had stilled itself. She thrust her head into his chest and gave a muffled scream.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&ndash;you fucking asshole.&rdquo; She pulled herself up, and wiped the blood and tears from her face and mouth. It never gets easier, she thought. You were right, old man.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She stilled herself. She lit a flame in the palm of her hand. She found herself walking, slowly, further into the tunnel, into that darkness, into the beautiful, beautiful world.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c2 c4 c3"></span></p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4Z2IqPRQ7SWHFQK1J9LrBb?si=387aa2b73cd54766"><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4 c3">These voices telling me let it go</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4 c3">I try and I try and I can&rsquo;t say no</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4 c3">This endless nightmare has just begun</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4 c3">My heart is dragging me down into</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Oblivion</span></a></p></body></html>
